Data(~.lhe), code to read data into root branches(readDM.py, LHEevent.py, LHEfile.py, plotTools.py) and draw them(Plot_E_Pt_Norm.py) to PDFs.

Read data: python readDm.py ~.lhe Optional.root
There is no need for Optional.root anymore as the rootfile name is generated automatically, for example: DMPseudo_Mphi10_Mchi1_g0p8.lhe -> python readDM.py DMPseudo_Mphi10_Mchi1_g0p8.lhe -> Pseudo_10_1_0p8.root
If you want to give your own name, just set Optional.root to your liking and it will use that instead of the automated one.

Draw Multiple Root Tree to Energy/Pt PDFs: python Plot_E_Pt_Norm.py OUTPUT_n1.root OUTPUT_n2.root etc
The model that you wish to compare with in the ratio plot should be used as 1st input like:
python Plot_E_Pt_Norm.py This_is_to_be_compared_with.root n2.root n3.root etc
